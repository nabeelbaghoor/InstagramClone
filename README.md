# InstagramClone
We are developing a simpler and abridged version of Instagram for a University Project.

# Students Assigned to different Layers:

Haseeb Ahmed    UI_Console
Rehman Butt     UI_Swing
Usama Zahid     UI_Swing
Ali Humza       DB_Text
Nabeel Hassan   DB_Firebase
Anser Butt      BL(Business Layer)

# Code Compilation and Code Execution

Different layer combinations can be used by manipulating a simple configuration file, by the name of Layer.cfg, placed in the Models package. Setting the “Database” property to “Firebase” allows for the program to work with a DB and setting the property to “Text” allows the program to work in a textual database.  The Interface used can be manipulated by changing the “User_Interface”, property to “Graphical” for a GUI and “Console” for a CLI. The “Main.java” class in the Package “Combination” needs to be run to execute the project.

# Updated Code Interfaces
